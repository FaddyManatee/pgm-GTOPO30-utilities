Module Name: pgmio
Programs: pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgma2b, pgmb2a, pgmReduce, pgmTile, pgmAssemble
Purpose: All programs deal with reading pgm files and writing them to disk.
It is useful to separate this code into a module included in these programs
to avoid repeated code and have a single point of failure. Files may be in
plaintext or binary, so the module will define functions to read in and write
ASCII pgm files and similar functions for binary pgm files. Uses pgmdata and 
pgmerror for structuring data and detecting errors upon read and write.

Module Name: pgmdata
Programs: pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgma2b, pgmb2a, pgmReduce, pgmTile, pgmAssemble
Purpose: Each program deals with pgm files. A data structure for packaging
pgm image data together would be useful as this helps with organisation of data
and readability, and we won't have to keep writing the definition into all files.
Defines two functions, one to initialise the the struct with sensible starting
values, and another to free memory allocated to variables of this struct type
when the program exits.

Module Name: pgmerror
Programs: pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgma2b, pgmb2a, pgmReduce, pgmTile, pgmAssemble
Purpose: Defines an error struct capable of storing an error code and its message relating
to errors that may occur when reading in pgm files, and the functions to check occurence of
specific errors during file read or write, such as null file pointers when files do not exist, 
or invalid file data. It defines constants related to pgm files such as image dimension bounds
and expected magic numbers to aid such error detection. References a header file containing the 
error codes and their related strings.

Module Name: pgmcompare
Programs: pgmComp
Purpose: Contains functions for comparing properties of data from two pgm files to evaluate logical
equivalence. Such functions will compare image dimensions, magic number, maximum gray value and the
image data itself for an exact match, regardless of whitespace and comments. If any of the comparisons
do not match, the two files do not describe the same image. It dhould be able to perform this operation
regardless if the pgm is in ASCII or binary format.

Module Name: pgmconvert
Programs: pgmComp, pgma2b, pgmb2a, pgmReduce, pgmTile, pgmAssemble
Purpose: Contains functions to convert read in ASCII encoded pgm file data to binary versions and vice
versa. Such code would need to appear in these programs, so it makes sense to modularise these
functions.

Module Name: pgmcrop (renamed to pgmshrink due to misconception)
Programs: pgmReduce
Purpose: Contains functions used to reduce a read-in pgm file by the specified factor. Such functions 
will include retrieving reduced row and column length using this factor, and another to construct a 
new pgm file with these new row and column lengths.

Module Name: pgmgroup
Programs: pgmTile, pgmAssemble
Purpose: Defines functions to disassemble and assemble pgm files. Both functionalites do the
opposite operation, so it makes sense to include both in one module.
